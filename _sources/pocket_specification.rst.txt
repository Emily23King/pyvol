====================
Pocket specification
====================

The GUI and PyMOL prompt interfaces are all but identical. The shell interface is run using input configuration files and is best used to automate tasks first tested within PyMOL. Explanations for running PyVOL with the PyMOL GUI or prompt are covered first. Additional details covering shell invocation follow. Programmatic invocation of internal functions is supported and covered through the module documentation.

Pocket Specification
--------------------

PyVOL by default recognizes the largest pocket and returns the volume and geometry for it. However, manual identification of the pocket of interest is generally preferable. This can be done through specification of a ligand, a residue, or a coordinate. If a specification is given, the mode is changed to specific by default.
