============
Installation
============

PyVOL consists of a back-end and a GUI. The back-end has been packaged into installers that contain all dependencies, but normal distribution is through PyPI and accessed through `pip`. PyVOL can consequently be installed into any python environment. For convenience, the PyVOL GUI contains an installer for easy installation into PyMOL 2.0+.

Installation into PyMOL from PyPI
---------------------------------
Download the :download:`basic GUI installer <https://github.com/schlessingerlab/pyvol/blob/master/installers/pyvol-installer.zip>`. Use the PyMOL plugin manager to install that file: :menuselection:`Plugins --> Plugin Manager` :menuselection:`Install New Plugin --> Install from local file` :guilabel:`Choose file...`

.. parsed-literal::

  https://github.com/schlessingerlab/pyvol/blob/master/installers/pyvol-installer.zip

This installs the PyVOL GUI. Select `PyVOL` under the plugins menu, and then select `Install from PyPI` under the settings tab to fetch PyVOL and any missing dependencies. For academic users and non-academic users with the Schrodinger incentive PyMOL distribution, installation is now complete. For all others, see manual installation of `msms` :ref:`below <MSMS_Installation>`.

Installation into PyMOL Using a Packaged Installer
--------------------------------------------------
This option is useful if deploying PyVOL onto computers without internet access. Download the `full installer zip file <https://github.com/schlessingerlab/pyvol/blob/master/installers/pyvol-full-installer.zip>`_ and then use the PyMOL plugin manager to install that file.

.. code-block:: bash

  https://github.com/schlessingerlab/pyvol/blob/master/installers/pyvol-full-installer.zip

This installs the PyVOL GUI. Select `PyVOL` under the plugins menu, and then select `Install from Local Cache` under the settings tab to install PyVOL and any missing dependencies from a cache contained within the installer itself. For academic users and non-academic users with the Schrodinger incentive PyMOL distribution, installation is now complete. For all others, see manual installation of `MSMS` :ref:`below <MSMS_Installation>`.

Manual Installation
-------------------
PyVOL minimally requires biopython, MSMS, numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, trimesh, and msms in order to run. PyVOL is available for manual installation from `github <https://github.com/schlessingerlab/pyvol>`_ or through `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/bio-pyvol/>`_. Most conveniently:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bio-pyvol

Again, for academic users and non-academic users with the Schrodinger incentive PyMOL distribution, installation is now complete. For all others, see manual installation of `MSMS` :ref:`below <MSMS_Installation>`.

MSMS Installation
-----------------
MSMS is provided with PyVOL for ease of use for academic users. It alternatively can be installed on MacOS and Linux using the bioconda channel:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c bioconda msms

Otherwise MSMS must be installed manually by downloading it from `MGLTools <http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/MSMS/>`_ and adding it to the path.

Updating
--------
PyVOL can be updated through the PyMOL GUI simply by clicking `Check for Updates` under the settings tab and subsequently clicking `Update PyVOL` if an update has been identified. The new version of the PyVOL back-end will notify you if it expects an updated GUI. If the GUI also needs to be updated, uninstall the `pyvol_gui` using the first tab of the plugin manager and then install the updated GUI using the second tab to install the `basic installer zip file <https://github.com/schlessingerlab/pyvol/blob/master/installers/pyvol-installer.zip>`_

Alternatively, PyVOL can be manually updated via the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip update bio-pyvol

Uninstalling
--------------
PyVOL can be uninstalled through its GUI. Simply click `Uninstall PyVOL` to remove the back-end. Then use the plugin manager to uninstall the `pyvol_plugin`.

Again, PyVOL can also be uninstalled via the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip uninstall bio-pyvol
